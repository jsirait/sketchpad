# Sketchpad UI Emulator

Emulating Sketchpad UI for COS583 course at Princeton University. 

Sketchpad was built in 1963 by Ivan Sutherland, and was a revolutionary computer graphics program that allowed users to 
create digital drawings interactively and edit them using constraint-based rules in real-time. 

In this implementation, constraints are applied in an iterative manner with the objective of error below some set threshold or 
some set max iteration. To satisfy constraints, points are moved in the direction that minimize error, where the direction 
of the move is calculated using geometric definitions of the constraints.

To run the program: 
```
./build.sh
```

Notes: 
(1) Constraints are only applicable to line objects -- future improvements include implementation of constraints for arc objects. 
(2) Creation of composites and objects duplication are yet to be implemented.
